# DeployImage
The goal of this PowerShell Module initially is to supply a better and easier way to image the new Nano Server from Microsoft.   However since the proesses are for the most part identical, I am going to extend this to Windows to Go deployments as well as standard servers (whether physical or virtual)

It will have to ability to create a Workgroup or Domain based Unattend.xml file to be injected directly into the destination environment.

In addition (as it grows and improves) it will be able to inject features directly into the relevant operating systems.

Another target of this Module is to allow easy Deployment of a Windows PE key that is PowerShell enabled.
